The ModuleNotFoundError you're encountering indicates that the Python interpreter can't find the src module when trying to import it within your test code. 
This is often an issue of the Python path not being set correctly. The test is being run from within the salesforce/shared/tests directory.
But Python doesn't know to look in the parent directory (salesforce/shared) for the src module.

To fix this issue, you need to adjust the PYTHONPATH environment variable within the GitHub Actions workflow to include the salesforce/shared directory.
